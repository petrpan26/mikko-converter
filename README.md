# mikko-converter

Inspired by [Nhat Nguyen](https://github.com/nhat-nguyen) and [Thao Tran](https://github.com/ThaoTrann).

A racket package I created to reduce the redundant consecutive pages of a pdf file.

The examples and names are based on Mikko Packlean and his amazing ECON 101 session in University of Waterloo.
